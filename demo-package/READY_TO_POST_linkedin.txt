Jeremy — appreciate the insight on Q-SLICE and QUANTA. The acceleration curve you're documenting aligns directly with what we're observing inside dna::}{::lang, where our ΛΦ-regulated coherence models and Γ-tensor threat signatures are exposing similar early-arrival risks.

We've been validating these patterns across 8,500+ IBM Quantum executions, and the threat timeline is definitely bending faster than consensus projections—especially as hybrid architectures stabilize coherence under real noise environments.

Your frameworks seem like a natural complement to our quantum-biological threat modeling layer. Would be interested in comparing notes on how Q-SLICE threat vectors map to Γ-spike signatures in our organism runtime.

Happy to share architecture details or explore collaboration—the overlap is increasingly relevant.
