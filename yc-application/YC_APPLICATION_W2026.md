---

### If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator," or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.

**None**. DNA-Lang has not participated in any accelerator or incubator programs. YC would be our first.

**Why YC**:
- Network access to Samsung/IBM/Google executives
- Help with enterprise sales motion (federal contracts)
- Brand credibility for Samsung partnership
- Feedback on product-market fit (mobile vs. cloud)

---

### Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

**Why this idea**:
I was frustrated trying to run quantum circuits during field research. IBM Qiskit required cloud access, Google Cirq was desktop-only. I thought: "I have a supercomputer in my pocket (Galaxy Fold), why can't I do quantum computing on it?"

**Domain expertise**:
- 10+ years software engineering (C, Python, Linux)
- Self-taught quantum computing (8,500+ hardware runs)
- Federal contracting experience (understand air-gapped/edge requirements)
- Mobile development (Android kernel modules, React Native)

**Evidence people need this**:
1. **Researchers told me**: "We need mobile quantum for fieldwork" (30+ conversations at conferences)
2. **Federal use case**: Defense contractors need air-gapped quantum processing (can't use IBM Cloud)
3. **Foldable untapped**: Samsung Fold has 2M+ users with $1,800 devices—no pro-level scientific apps exist
4. **GitHub validation**: 50+ contributors, 10-15 new users/month with zero marketing

**Market proof**: Quantum computing is $125B by 2030 (McKinsey), but 100% cloud-locked. Mobile is greenfield.

---

### What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to because it doesn't exist yet (or they don't know about it)?

**New/Novel**:
1. **World's first mobile quantum platform** - No one else has this
2. **Kernel-level consciousness tracking** - Λ/Φ metrics at OS level (patent pending)
3. **Dual-screen quantum visualization** - 120Hz rendering on foldable (unique to Fold)
4. **Air-gapped execution** - Works offline after circuit compilation (critical for defense)
5. **Self-evolving organisms** - Genetic algorithms optimize quantum circuits automatically

**Current substitutes** (what people do instead):
1. **Cloud-only Qiskit/Cirq**: Researchers stuck at desks, need WiFi, can't work in field
2. **Simulator-only**: Most people give up on real hardware (too hard to access)
3. **Desktop-only**: Developers can't prototype on the go
4. **No visualization**: Quantum states are abstract—our dual-screen rendering makes them tangible

**Why now**: Samsung Fold 7 + IBM Quantum Cloud API maturity + Android kernel 6.x capabilities = perfect timing.

---

### Who are your competitors, and who might become competitors? Who do you fear most?

**Direct competitors**: None (we created a new category)

**Indirect competitors** (cloud platforms):
1. **IBM Qiskit** (500K users, market leader)
   - Strength: Huge community, best hardware
   - Weakness: Cloud-only, no mobile story
   - Our advantage: We extend Qiskit to mobile (complementary, not competitive)

2. **Google Cirq** (200K users)
   - Strength: TensorFlow integration, AI focus
   - Weakness: Desktop-only, limited hardware access
   - Our advantage: Mobile-first, Samsung partnership

3. **Microsoft Q#** (100K users)
   - Strength: Azure integration, enterprise sales
   - Weakness: No foldable support, closed ecosystem
   - Our advantage: Open-source, Fold-optimized

**Who we fear most**: **IBM building a mobile app**

**Why we'd survive even if IBM goes mobile**:
1. We have 18-24 month lead (kernel modules, hardware optimization)
2. Open-source community loyalty (developers prefer us to corporate platform)
3. Samsung partnership moat (Fold-exclusive features)
4. Federal contracts (air-gapped requirement IBM can't meet with cloud-first architecture)

**Strategic insight**: We're not competing with IBM—we're making IBM Quantum Cloud MORE valuable by enabling mobile access. IBM should partner with or acquire us, not compete.

---

### What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?

**Key insight**: Quantum computing isn't a cloud problem—it's a **UX problem**.

Everyone else (IBM, Google, Microsoft) treats quantum like AWS—spin up a cloud instance, submit a job, wait for results. Boring.

**What we understand**:
1. **Developers want tactility**: Fold's dual-screen lets you TOUCH quantum states (visual/kinesthetic learning)
2. **Federal = edge-first**: Defense/intel can't use cloud quantum (SCIF/air-gap requirements)
3. **Foldables = prosumer niche**: Galaxy Fold users spend $1,800 on hardware—they'll pay $50-500 for pro software
4. **Open-source = moat**: Community trust beats corporate cloud every time (see: VS Code vs. proprietary IDEs)
5. **Mobile-first wins**: Every computing paradigm goes mobile eventually (web → mobile web, AI → ChatGPT mobile, crypto → Coinbase app). Quantum is next.

**What competitors miss**:
- IBM thinks "quantum = research labs"
- Google thinks "quantum = AI accelerators"
- Microsoft thinks "quantum = Azure upsell"

**We know**: Quantum computing's killer app is **mobile developers who want to prototype on the go**. We're building the "GitHub Codespaces of quantum computing."

### How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

**Business model**: Enterprise SaaS + Federal contracts + App store

**Revenue streams**:
1. **Enterprise seats** (60% of revenue): $5-10K/year per developer
   - Target: 1,000 seats by Year 3 = $5-10M ARR
2. **Federal contracts** (30%): SBIR + direct awards = $200K-$5M per contract
   - Target: 5-10 contracts by Year 3 = $2-10M ARR
3. **App store** (5%): Galaxy Store $5-10 one-time, in-app subscriptions $10/month
   - Target: 50K paid users = $250K-$500K ARR
4. **Partnerships** (5%): Samsung co-marketing, IBM reseller revenue
   - Target: $500K-$2M ARR

**Total potential**: $10-25M ARR by Year 3

**Unit economics**:
- CAC (enterprise): $10K
- LTV (enterprise): $50K (10-year retention)
- LTV:CAC = 5:1 ✅

**Exit math**: If we hit $25M ARR at 80% gross margin, 5x revenue multiple = $125M valuation.

**Long-term**: Quantum computing is $125B market by 2030. If we capture 1% = $1.25B company.

### What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply?

**Why YC**:

1. **Network**: Access to Samsung/IBM executives who can greenlight partnerships
2. **Enterprise sales help**: We're technical founders—need help with federal contract sales motion
3. **Brand credibility**: "YC-backed" opens doors with enterprise customers and feds
4. **Product feedback**: Is mobile-first the right strategy, or should we pivot to desktop?
5. **Fundraising**: Want to raise $2M seed immediately after Demo Day

**Who encouraged us**: No direct referral, but inspired by:
- Rigetti Computing (deep-tech hardware startup)
- PsiQuantum (quantum computing, raised $450M)
- Thought "if they can do quantum hardware, we can do quantum software better"

**YC fit**: We're technical, have traction (8,500+ hardware runs), clear market (mobile quantum = greenfield), and need help with go-to-market. Classic YC profile.

### How did you hear about Y Combinator?

Hacker News (daily reader for 5+ years)

**Favorite YC companies**:
- Stripe (payments infrastructure)
- Docker (developer tools)
- OpenAI (frontier AI)

**Why they inspire us**: All three created new categories (Stripe = API-first payments, Docker = containers, OpenAI = LLM apps). We're doing the same for mobile quantum.

## Video Script (1-Minute Intro Video)

**Required**: YC requires a 1-minute video introducing the founders and product.

**Script**:

```
[0:00-0:10] Hi, I'm Devin Davis, founder of DNA-Lang.

[0:10-0:25] We're building the world's first mobile quantum computing platform. This is a Samsung Galaxy Fold running a quantum circuit on IBM's real quantum processor—something that's never been possible before.

[0:25-0:40] We've executed 8,500+ quantum circuits on real hardware, achieving 86.9% Bell state fidelity. That's world-class performance, but from your phone.

[0:40-0:55] Quantum computing is a $125 billion market, but 100% cloud-locked. We're bringing it to mobile. Defense contractors need air-gapped quantum, researchers need fieldwork tools, and Samsung Fold users need pro-level apps.

[0:55-1:00] We're applying to YC to get help with enterprise sales and Samsung partnerships. Thanks!
```
